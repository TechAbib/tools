About Wellenreiter:
	Wellenreiter is a gtkperl program that makes the discovery and auditing
	of 802.11b wireless networks as easy as possible. For discovery of the 
	accesspoints / networks / ad-hoc cards, Wellenreiter has an amazingly 
	easy to use scanner window, which searches for any accesspoint within 
        the range of the scanning device.  It detects and differentiates essid 
	broadcasting and non-broadcasting wireless networks. The manufacturer 
	is detected by the device's MAC address. WEP and BSS / IBSS detection 
	is also implemented. Detecting essid's of non-broadcasting networks is 
	possible and gps support is also built in (Requires gpsd). 
	Wellenreiter is the first Wireless scanner that does not need to be 
	configured anymore. Its amazing autodetection takes care about taking
	the correct cardtype and using the right comands. Lucent/Orinocco, Cisco
	and Prism2/2.5 (WLAN-NG drivers) based Cards are supported now. 
	NO, hosap drivers actualy don't work in this version, stay tuned for that.

	The Networks with a red symbol are "non-essid-broadcasting" ones.  This
	means the accesspoint does not send out the essid network name for
	security reasons.  Non-broadcasting networks can be only detected by
	using the raw-sniffing mode.  Green symbols are shown for a broadcasting
	network.

	The distinction between WEP/cleartext sending accesspoints is indicated
	by the word "ON" or "OFF" and a little open or closed lock icon. 
	
	AD-Hoc stations (BSS) have different icons than real accesspoints (IBSS).

	Channels that are holding new objects are colored red until you select it.

	The pkt indicator on the right side of the listview alternates between the 
	two characters "+" and "*". When it alternates, this accesspoint is sending
	traffic. So its a traffic indication.

	If you click on an object in the treeview you will get the detail window. 
	This window refresh after a while. Keep it open to see arp and dhcp traffic.

	Use the logwindow to take care of all your findings and the trafficwindow
	to see what packets are coming in.

	Oh...one word about saving....it automaticly saves a dump and a savefile to your 
	homedrive.
